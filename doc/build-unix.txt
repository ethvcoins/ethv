UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

To Build
--------

cd src/
make -f makefile.unix            # Headless ETHV

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building ETHV QT,
the graphical ETHV.

Dependencies
------------

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support
 libqrencode QRCode generation Optional QRCode generation

Note that libexecinfo should be installed, if you building under *BSD systems.
This library provides backtrace facility.

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE_QRCODE to control this:
 USE_QRCODE=0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE_QRCODE=1   QRCode support enabled

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
 Boost         MIT-like license
 miniupnpc     New (3-clause) BSD license

Versions used in this release:
 GCC           7.3
 OpenSSL       1.1.0g
 Berkeley DB   5.3.28.NC
 Boost         1.65.1
 miniupnpc     1.9.20140401

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev
sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev

## optional, manual install at below
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev # openssl 1.1.0 above
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev # boost 1.65.1 above
sudo apt-get install libqt5-dev

If using Boost 1.37, append -mt to the boost libraries in the makefile.

## only for older version
if libssl is 1.1 above, temporary solution:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get remove libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install -t jessie-backports libssl-dev

## downgrade used
sudo ln -nfs /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0 /usr/lib/libssl.so


Dependency Build Instructions: Gentoo
-------------------------------------

emerge -av1 --noreplace boost openssl sys-libs/db

Take the following steps to build (no UPnP support):
 cd ${ETHV_DIR}/src
 make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=
 strip ethvd


Notes
-----
The release is built with GCC and then "strip ethvd" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.

GCC
---
#sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test # remove starting # if PPA added before
#sudo ppa-purge ppa:jonathonf/gcc-7.3 # remove starting # if PPA added before
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:jonathonf/gcc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-7 # will install 7.3.0-5ubuntu1~16.04.york0



openssl 1.1.0g
--------------
apt-get remove libssl-dev openssl libcrypto++* #remove the old version ssl
wget https://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.1.0g.tar.gz
tar xzvf openssl-1.1.0g.tar.gz
cd openssl-1.1.0g
./config -Wl,--enable-new-dtags,-rpath,'$(LIBRPATH)'
make && make install

**reboot**
openssl version -a
~~ you should see something like : OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017


miniupnpc
---------
tar -xzvf miniupnpc-1.6.tar.gz
cd miniupnpc-1.6
make
sudo su
make install


Berkeley DB
-----------
You need Berkeley DB. If you have to build Berkeley DB yourself:
../dist/configure --enable-cxx
make


Boost
-----
If you need to build Boost yourself:
sudo su
./bootstrap.sh
./bjam install

[dependencies]
apt-get install build-essential g++ python-dev autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev libboost-all-dev

wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.65.1/source/boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
tar xzvf boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
cd boost_1_65_1

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/
./b2
sudo ./b2 install
sudo apt-get remove libboost-*-dev
**reboot**

[check boost version]
cat /usr/include/boost/version.hpp | grep "BOOST_LIB_VERSION"


Error debug
-----------
if show "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lz"
apt-get install zlib1g-dev

error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
cp /usr/local/lib/libssl.so.1.1 /usr/lib

mkdir -p obj

Security
--------
To help make your ETHV installation more secure by making certain attacks impossible to
exploit even if a vulnerability is found, you can take the following measures:

* Position Independent Executable
    Build position independent code to take advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization
    offered by some kernels. An attacker who is able to cause execution of code at an arbitrary
    memory location is thwarted if he doesn't know where anything useful is located.
    The stack and heap are randomly located by default but this allows the code section to be
    randomly located as well.

    On an Amd64 processor where a library was not compiled with -fPIC, this will cause an error
    such as: "relocation R_X86_64_32 against `......' can not be used when making a shared object;"

    To build with PIE, use:
    make -f makefile.unix ... -e PIE=1

    To test that you have built PIE executable, install scanelf, part of paxutils, and use:
    scanelf -e ./ethv

    The output should contain:
     TYPE
    ET_DYN

* Non-executable Stack
    If the stack is executable then trivial stack based buffer overflow exploits are possible if
    vulnerable buffers are found. By default, ETHV should be built with a non-executable stack
    but if one of the libraries it uses asks for an executable stack or someone makes a mistake
    and uses a compiler extension which requires an executable stack, it will silently build an
    executable without the non-executable stack protection.

    To verify that the stack is non-executable after compiling use:
    scanelf -e ./ethv

    the output should contain:
    STK/REL/PTL
    RW- R-- RW-

    The STK RW- means that the stack is readable and writeable but not executable.
